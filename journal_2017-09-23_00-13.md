# things i learned today

- just submitted a pull request to curateteaching/digitalpedagogy
	- first, committed changes to my local fork of the repo
	- then, pushed changes to my fork on github
	- then, clicked ```New Pull Request``` and used the "compare across forks" link to find my fork
	- finally, clicked to open the request
- what i *should* have done first: create a new branch in my own fork
- that way, i would have been able to keep the previous version of the file in question in sync with the main repo and submit the new request from the new branch of my fork rather than from my master branch

So here's something else to say.

And something else.

What happened to the line I added before?
